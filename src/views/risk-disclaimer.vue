          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            This document highlights the risks associated with using AlphaBot, a trading bot. Key points include market 
            volatility, reliance on the AlphaInsider strategy with no guarantee of future performance, dependence on 
            automation with reduced manual control, user responsibility for decision-making, and legal terms including 
            indemnification, governing law, and disclaimers. Activation of AlphaBot indicates your understanding and 
            acceptance of these risks and terms.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            This document outlines the risks associated with using AlphaBot "The Bot", a user-owned trading bot. Before activating 
            the bot, it is crucial to understand these risks thoroughly.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Market Volatility</h3>
          <p>Financial markets are inherently volatile and unpredictable. Risks include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sudden market shifts:</strong> Prices of assets can fluctuate rapidly, leading to losses on your investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Black swan events:</strong> Unforeseen events like economic crises or natural disasters can significantly impact market performance, resulting in substantial losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical issues:</strong> System malfunctions or errors within AlphaBot itself could lead to inappropriate trading decisions and financial losses.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Investment Strategy Performance</h3>
          <p>
            The performance of the AlphaInsider strategy you choose directly impacts your portfolio's performance. While the
            strategy may have performed well historically, past performance is not indicative of future results. You should be
            prepared to face potential losses if the strategy underperforms or fails to meet your expectations.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Reliance on Automation</h3>
          <p>
            By activating AlphaBot, you are relying on automated algorithms and trading decisions. This means you relinquish some
            control over your portfolio and entrust The Bot with making investment decisions. While AlphaBot strives to maximize
            returns, there is no guarantee of success.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Limited Trading Control</h3>
          <p>
            AlphaBot's activation limits manual trading of cash or reserves, potentially impacting your ability to invest 
            or adjust your portfolio.
          </p>

          <h3>6. User Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            It is your sole responsibility to understand and accept the risks involved before activating AlphaBot. You are
            responsible for conducting your own research and due diligence before choosing an AlphaInsider strategy and trusting
            The Bot with your investments.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Indemnification</h3>
          <p>
            By activating AlphaBot, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the creators of The Bot from any and all claims,
            losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from your use of The Bot, including those mentioned above.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Governing Law</h3>
          <p>
            These terms and conditions are governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
            regard to its conflict of laws principles.
          </p>
